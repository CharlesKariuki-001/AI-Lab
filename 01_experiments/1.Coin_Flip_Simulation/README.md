# Coin Flip Simulation

This is my first experiment in the AI-Lab repository. It simulates flipping a coin multiple times and calculates the probability of heads and tails.

## How it works

- The program flips a coin 1000 times (can be changed).
- Counts how many times it lands on **Heads** or **Tails**.
- Calculates probabilities for each outcome.
- Displays a bar chart of the results using `matplotlib`.

## How to run

1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install matplotlib


3. Run the script:



## Output

- Counts of Heads and Tails.
- Probabilities of Heads and Tails.
- A bar chart visualizing the results.
